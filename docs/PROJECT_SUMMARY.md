### Key Algorithms

1. **EV Calculation**
   ```
   EV = Σ(prize_amount × probability) - ticket_price
   Adjusted EV = base_EV × weights × recency_bias × concentration_score
   ```

2. **Hotness Score**
   ```
   Hotness = ΔEV/Δt + recency_factor + geographic_clustering
   Scale: 0-100 (higher = hotter)
   ```

3. **Heat Score (Stores)**
   ```
   Score = recency_score(40) + payout_score(30) + big_win_score(20) + streak_score(10)
   ```

4. **AI Prediction**
   ```
   Predicted_Hotness = Current + Σ(signal_strength × 15) × timeframe_multiplier
   Confidence = avg(signal_strengths) × 50 + pattern_confidence × 0.3
   ```
