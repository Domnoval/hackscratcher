---

## **PHASE 2: Configure Production APIs** (15-30 minutes)
*Goal: Set up required third-party services*

### Step 2.1: Get Google Maps API Key

**Why needed**: Store heat map feature requires Google Maps

**Steps**:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Click "Select a Project" ‚Üí "New Project"
3. Name: "Scratch Oracle"
4. Click "Create"
5. Wait for project creation (30 seconds)
6. Click "Enable APIs and Services"
7. Search "Maps SDK for Android"
8. Click "Enable"
9. Go to "Credentials" tab (left sidebar)
10. Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "API Key"
11. Copy the API key (starts with `AIza...`)
12. Click "Restrict Key"
13. Under "Application restrictions":
    - Select "Android apps"
    - Click "Add an item"
    - Package name: `com.scratchoracle.app`
    - SHA-1: Leave blank for now (we'll add later)

  "googleMaps": {
    "apiKey": "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"  # Replace with your actual key
  }
}
```

**Task**:
- [ ] Google Maps API key obtained
- [ ] API key restricted to Android
- [ ] API key added to app.json

---

### Step 2.2: Initialize EAS (Expo Application Services)

**Why needed**: Required to build production APK/AAB files

**Steps**:
```bash
# Install EAS CLI globally (if not installed)
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo (create free account if needed)
eas login

# Initialize EAS project (creates Project ID)
cd D:\Scratch_n_Sniff\scratch-oracle-app
eas init
```

**What happens**:
- You'll be prompted to create an Expo account (free)
- EAS will generate a unique Project ID
- Example output: `Project ID: abc123-def456-ghi789`

**Update app.json**:
```bash
# Find line 72-74:
"extra": {
  "eas": {
    "projectId": "YOUR_EAS_PROJECT_ID"  # Replace with ID from eas init
  }
}
```

**Task**:

# Configure build settings (if not already done)
eas build:configure
```

**When prompted**:
- Platform: `Android` (press Enter)
- Generate new keystore: `Yes` (press Enter)

**This creates/updates**: `eas.json` (already exists in your project)

**Task**:
- [ ] EAS build configured
- [ ] Keystore will be auto-generated

---

### Step 3.2: Create Preview Build (Test APK)

**Important**: Preview builds create APKs (installable files). Production builds create AABs (for Play Store). We'll do preview first to test.

```bash
# Start the build (runs in Expo's cloud)
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

**What happens**:
1. Code is uploaded to Expo servers

- [ ] Monitor progress: https://expo.dev/accounts/[your-username]/projects/scratch-oracle-app/builds

**After build completes**:

---

### Step 3.3: Install & Test APK on Real Device

3. Tap to install
4. If blocked: Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí "Install from unknown sources" ‚Üí Enable
5. Install app

**Test Everything** (spend 30 minutes):
- [ ] **Age Verification**: Works and persists
- [ ] **Recommendations**: EV calculations display correctly
- [ ] **Barcode Scanner**: Camera opens (try scanning a real barcode)
- [ ] **Win/Loss Tracker**: Add manual entries ‚Üí Stats calculate
