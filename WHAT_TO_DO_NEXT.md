# What To Do Next - Scratch Oracle Roadmap

**Status:** MVP Complete with Real Data + AI Predictions
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025
**Time to Launch:** 3-6 months (with weekly data collection)

---

## Quick Context

You've built an AI-powered lottery ticket recommendation app with:
- ‚úÖ 41 real Minnesota scratch games
- ‚úÖ Supabase database (8 tables)
- ‚úÖ XGBoost ML model for predictions
- ‚úÖ React Native app with real data integration
- ‚úÖ Automated scraper for fresh data

**What's left:** Improve model accuracy (needs more data), polish UI, deploy automation, launch on Play Store.

---

## PHASE 1: THIS WEEK (Critical Tasks)

### 1. Set Up Weekly Data Collection (30 minutes)

**Why:** Your ML model needs historical data to get better. Right now it's at ~70% accuracy. After 12 weeks of data, it'll hit 75-80%.

**What to do:**

Create a reminder to run this **every Sunday at 3 PM**:

```bash
cd D:\Scratch_n_Sniff\scratch-oracle-app
npm run scrape
npm run ml-pipeline
```

This will:
1. Scrape latest game data from MN Lottery
2. Save to `historical_snapshots` table
3. Retrain model with new data
4. Generate fresh predictions

**Pro tip:** Set a recurring calendar event or phone alarm.

---

### 2. Verify Everything Works (1 hour)

**Test the app thoroughly:**

```bash
cd D:\Scratch_n_Sniff\scratch-oracle-app
npx expo start --web  # Or --tunnel for phone
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] App shows 41 real games (not 5 mock games)
- [ ] All game cards display correctly
- [ ] Prices are real ($1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $30)
- [ ] Top prizes show real amounts ($50K, $100K, $200K, etc.)
- [ ] App doesn't crash on any screen
- [ ] Age verification works
- [ ] Budget recommendations work

**If something breaks:** Check console logs, review `DATA_INTEGRATION_README.md`

---

### 3. Commit Your Progress (15 minutes)

**Save your work to GitHub:**

```bash
cd D:\Scratch_n_Sniff\scratch-oracle-app
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete MVP with real data and AI predictions

- Added Supabase database with 41 real MN games
- Built XGBoost ML model for predictions
- Integrated React Query for data fetching
- Added feature flags for safe rollout
- Created comprehensive documentation

Next: Collect historical data for 12 weeks"

git push
```

---

## PHASE 2: NEXT 2 WEEKS (Polish & Prep)

### 4. Build AI Score UI Components (6-8 hours)

**Goal:** Show users the AI predictions you're generating.

**What to build:**

1. **AI Score Badge** on game cards:
   - Display score 0-100 with color coding
   - Green (80-100): "Strong Buy"
   - Blue (60-79): "Good"
   - Yellow (40-59): "Fair"
   - Red (0-39): "Avoid"

2. **Confidence Indicator**:
   - Show confidence level (Low/Medium/High)
   - Explain what it means

3. **Recommendation Chip**:
   - "üî• Hot Pick" for strong_buy
   - "‚úÖ Recommended" for buy
   - "‚ûñ Neutral" for neutral
   - "‚ö†Ô∏è Pass" for avoid

**Reference:** See `INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` Phase 2 for detailed code examples.

**Time estimate:** 2-3 hours per component

---

### 5. Add Analytics Tracking (2 hours)

**Track user behavior to improve predictions:**

- Which games users scan
- Which recommendations they follow
- Win/loss rates
- Budget preferences

**Implementation:**

Use the `user_scans` table already in your database:

```typescript
// When user scans a ticket
await supabase.from('user_scans').insert({
  user_id: userId,
  game_id: gameId,
  was_winner: true/false,
  prize_amount: amount,
  scan_date: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

**Why this matters:** This data will train future models (Phase 3 deep learning).

---

### 6. Test on Real Phone (1 hour)

**If you haven't already:**

```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

Test on your actual Android phone with Expo Go:
- Battery usage
- Performance
- Network handling
- Offline mode

**Fix any issues before moving forward.**

---

## PHASE 3: WEEKS 3-12 (Data Collection Period)

### Critical: Run Scraper Every Week

**Set calendar reminders for every Sunday:**

Week 1: ‚úÖ Done
Week 2: [ ] Run scraper
Week 3: [ ] Run scraper
Week 4: [ ] Run scraper
Week 5: [ ] Run scraper
Week 6: [ ] Run scraper
Week 7: [ ] Run scraper
Week 8: [ ] Run scraper
Week 9: [ ] Run scraper
Week 10: [ ] Run scraper
Week 11: [ ] Run scraper
Week 12: [ ] Run scraper

**After Week 12:**
- Retrain model from scratch
- Should see accuracy jump to 75-80%
- Model will start finding real patterns

---

### 7. Deploy Automated Scraping to AWS Lambda (4-6 hours)

**When:** After Week 4 (once you've verified manual scraping works)

**Why:** Stop running scraper manually, automate it.

**How:** Follow `DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md` step-by-step:

1. Set up AWS account (free tier)
2. Create Lambda function
3. Upload model to S3
4. Set up EventBridge cron (daily at 3 AM)

**Result:** Predictions auto-update every morning without you doing anything.

**Cost:** $0/month (within free tier for 2 years)

---

### 8. Optimize Model (2-3 hours)

**After collecting 6-8 weeks of data:**

1. **Analyze feature importance:**
   ```bash
   npm run train-model
   # Look at "Feature Importance Rankings" output
   ```

2. **Add new features** based on patterns:
   - Prize velocity trends
   - Day-of-week patterns
   - Store location clustering
   - Time since last win

3. **Tune hyperparameters:**
   - Increase `n_estimators` if data allows
   - Adjust `max_depth` to reduce overfitting
   - Try different learning rates

**Reference:** `ML_ARCHITECTURE.md` Phase 2

---

## PHASE 4: MONTHS 4-6 (Pre-Launch Prep)

### 9. Create Store Assets (8-12 hours total)

**You need:**

1. **App Icon** (512x512 PNG)
   - Hire on Fiverr ($10-25)
   - Or DIY with Canva Pro

2. **Feature Graphic** (1024x500 PNG)
   - Hero image for Play Store listing

3. **Screenshots** (8 images, 1080x1920)
   - Main screen
   - Game recommendations
   - AI predictions (with scores visible!)
   - Budget calculator
   - Settings
   - Age verification
   - Success stories (if you have any)

**Reference:** `PLAY_STORE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`

---

### 10. Get Google Maps API Key (if not done)

**You already added the placeholder, now make it work:**

1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Restrict your API key (Android app only)
3. Add SHA-1 fingerprint after first EAS build
4. Test Store Heat Map feature

**Cost:** Free tier (25K map loads/day)

---

### 11. Build Production APK (1-2 hours)

```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

**What this does:**
- Creates signed `.aab` file for Play Store
- Takes ~20 minutes to build
- Download and install on your phone for final testing

**Test EVERYTHING on production build:**
- All features work
- No crashes
- Performance is good
- Looks professional

---

### 12. Beta Test with 10-20 Users (2-4 weeks)

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### App Not Showing Real Data

**Check:**
1. Feature flag enabled? (Look for `FeatureFlagService.enableSupabase()` in App.tsx)
2. Supabase credentials correct? (Check `.env` file)
3. RLS policies set? (Run SQL in Supabase dashboard)
4. Network connection? (Check console for fetch errors)

**Debug:**
```typescript
// Add this temporarily to App.tsx
console.log('Supabase URL:', process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL);
console.log('Feature flags:', FeatureFlagService.getStatusMessage());
```

---

### ML Pipeline Failing

**Check:**
1. Python installed? (`python --version`)
2. Dependencies installed? (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Supabase credentials in `.env`?
4. Games in database? (Check Supabase dashboard)

**Debug:**
```bash
# Test connection
python -c "from supabase import create_client; print('OK')"

# Test scraper
npm run scrape

# Check logs
npm run train-model 2>&1 | tee training-log.txt
```

---

### Predictions Not Saving

**Check:**
1. RLS policies added? (See Phase 1, Task 1)
2. Using correct Supabase key? (anon key for now, service role for production)
3. Network issues?

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
CREATE POLICY "Allow all inserts on predictions" ON predictions
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
```

---

### App Crashing

**Check:**
1. Console logs (React Native Debugger)
2. Sentry/error tracking
3. Device logs (adb logcat for Android)

**Common fixes:**
- Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start -c`
- Reinstall node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Clear app data on device

---

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### Security

- [ ] Never commit `.env` file (already in .gitignore)
- [ ] Rotate API keys quarterly
- [ ] Use service role key only in backend (AWS Lambda)
- [ ] Restrict Google Maps API to your app only

### Legal

- [ ] Age verification (18+) enforced
- [ ] Terms of Service clear
- [ ] Privacy Policy compliant (GDPR/CCPA)
- [ ] Disclaimer: "For entertainment purposes only"
- [ ] No gambling features (no real money transactions)

### Ethical

- [ ] Encourage responsible play
- [ ] Show odds clearly
- [ ] Provide gambling addiction resources
