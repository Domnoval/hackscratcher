## üí° OPEN FORUM - QUESTIONS & CONCERNS

### Security Team
**Q:** Are we confident in our RLS policies?
**A:** ‚úÖ Yes. Tested and validated. Users can only access their own data.

**Q:** What about API key exposure?
**A:** ‚úÖ Keys are in environment variables, not committed to code. Supabase Anon Key is public-safe (rate-limited).

---

### Legal Team
**Q:** Are we exposed to liability for gambling?
**A:** ‚úÖ No. We don't sell tickets, process payments, or guarantee wins. Clear disclaimers throughout.

**Q:** What if a state lottery sends a cease & desist?
**A:** We'd comply immediately. Using public data + clear disclaimers = low risk. Similar apps exist (Jackpocket, etc.)

---

### UX Team
**Q:** Should we launch with new Vegas theme or current design?
**A:** ‚ö†Ô∏è DECISION NEEDED
- **Option A:** Launch now with current design (faster, less risk)
- **Option B:** Delay 1 week, integrate Vegas theme first (better first impression)

**Recommendation:** Launch with current design (professional, tested), iterate post-launch based on user feedback.

---

### Product Team
**Q:** What about the Hot Spots Map feature?
**A:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION
- High viral potential
- Legal gray area (location tracking, retailer data)
- Recommend: Research legal implications first, add Phase 2

**Q:** Community Stories feature?
**A:** üí° GREAT IDEA - BUT LATER
- Requires moderation (spam, fake wins)
- Legal liability (false advertising claims)
- Recommend: Add after 1,000+ users, hire moderator

---

### Engineering Team
**Q:** Build time was 3 hours. Is that normal?
**A:** ‚úÖ Yes. First production build with 434 modules. Future builds will be faster (~10-20 min).

**Q:** Scraper reliability?
**A:** ‚úÖ Tested, working. Daily automation ready. Monitor for website changes.
